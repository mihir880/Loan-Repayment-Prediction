# Loan-Repayment-Prediction

I am trying to analyze whether there is loan repayment among the citizens. To determine this, we did data cleaning, visualization and classification on a dataset which shows user loan_data USA. Developed a machine learning model to predict loan repayment status using K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, achieving an F1-score of 0.86.
